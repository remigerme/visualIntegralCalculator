# A VISUAL INTEGRAL CALCULATOR

I wanted to give Javascript a little try. Well, it wasn't that funny.

## Usage

First go to the [repo's webpage](https://remigerme.github.io/visualIntegralCalculator/).
Then click on **How to use** if you have any doubt.

## Note

I know that it is absolutely inefficient and that there should be a choice between rectangles and trapezoids to calculate the integral, but the framework does not offer that.
